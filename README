GETTING STARTED
Visit the downloads section to obtain the latest version of Quartz.Net Manager. You can now download a zipped version as well as an MSI installer.

CUSTOM JOBS
You must let the program know which assemblies contain your jobs. You do so by editing the JobAssemblies.txt file and adding your assemblies there. Only jobs from the assemblies listed in that file will get loaded. Alternatively, select the Assemblies menu option from the Quartz.Net Manager menu and add the assemblies there.
